    In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk blah blah... yeah sure. We all know what a tree is. But do we know how important they are? 
    Trees come from seeds and are planted and got through a process of germintation by the help of certain factors such as light and moisture
    to emerge from their shell as it were.
