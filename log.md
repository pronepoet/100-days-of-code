# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started coding this tree website. Added some slide effects to the jquery and bootstrap for styling.

**Thoughts**: I was tired today but had to start my journey otherwise it would remain a dream. I love JQUERY and how interesting you can get it to perform interesting animations with just simple lines of code. I also noticed placing a row item inside the page without nesting it inside of the bootstrap container element gives the column items some space between them. Flexbox is nice but my images were overflowing out of the field of view. PS. Technically this project was started yesterday so...

### Day 1: March 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Added some information about Moringa and put it in the grid system. Added the licence and deployed my site to gh-pages.

**Thoughts**: I love bootstrap :).I did not do much today in my site, but had good fun learning objects. Can't wait to grasp this concept and put it to practice.

### Day 2: March 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Added more content to my trees website. Changes the font styling for different sections of the page and added the footer section wih the disqus Api.

**Thoughts**: I was tired but going on strong :) I love the different api template disqus gives you. I'm going to create my own version of this

### Day 3: March 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about a different way of creating objects through the use of constructors. Also learnt about prototypes and how they are used.

**Thoughts**: Constructors definitely make the use of objects much easier. A little challenging to understand but am sure I'll get in in time

### Day 4: March 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Used the concepts learnt on day 3 to make a pizza delivery app

**Thoughts**: I need to work on responsiveness. Also look for an api to get real locations. Also I need to work on constructors a little more, still rusty here.

### Day 5: March 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Object constructors, css styling, JQUERY and Bootsrtap styling 

**Thoughts**: I was tired from a group project and these skills I got from the project are the ones I had learnt and posted about. Awesome working in a team as marvelous as the one I worked with. Pentagon!

### Day 6: March 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Added mailchimp api to the project Delani Studio. Updated some css styling also and formated it correctly.

**Thoughts**: I need to look for a way to incorporate the contact form here that adds the message feature.

### Day 7: March 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Updated my project to have better syling for beauty purposes. My contact section also had to be styled to have a transparent form from mailchimp.

**Thoughts**: My images do not display in github live. Why? (I guess github takes time to upload files)

### Day 8: March 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started learning Angular. Wish me luck!

**Thoughts**: Seems like an easier way of coding, with Typescript.
