# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started coding this tree website. Added some slide effects to the jquery and bootstrap for styling.

**Thoughts**: I was tired today but had to start my journey otherwise it would remain a dream. I love JQUERY and how interesting you can get it to perform interesting animations with just simple lines of code. I also noticed placing a row item inside the page without nesting it inside of the bootstrap container element gives the column items some space between them. Flexbox is nice but my images were overflowing out of the field of view. PS. Technically this project was started yesterday so...
